# Paragraph Islands

A useful application that separates long text into chunks to make reading easier!

## Installation

Visit the StackBlitz link or download the source files into any code editor.

## Usage

Take any book, scan and copy text using a phone, then paste the text into the *text.txt* file. Run the express project using

~~~
node index.js
~~~

Then, refer to the terminal for instructions. Enter the desired size of the text "chunks" (number of sentences). Then there should be the input text but decorated with dividers and split into the right amount of sentences!

## Notes
1. Because StackBlitz does not support any commands to run C++, this demo can only work with the js() function. If you dowloaded this project into a different code editor and want to leverage the *speed and power of C++*, then just swap the js() function with the cpp() function called in the write() function
2. No "$" or ":" in input text
